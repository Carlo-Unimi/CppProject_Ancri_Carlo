# Solvers for special computational problems

This project provides solvers for various combinatorial optimization problems:
- **AP** — Assignment Problem
- **GAP** — Generalized Assignment Problem
- **UFLP** — Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem

The project is written in C++ and structured modularly with separate source (`src`) and header (`include`) files.
